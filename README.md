# Advent of Code 2018

My attempt at solving the series of programming puzzles from [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2018), in (typed) Python.

## Running

To run the code for day `N` and obtain the answers for my input :

```sh
python run.py N
```

## Tests

To run tests for day `N` :

```sh
# use --verbose or -v for detailed output
python run.py --tests N
```
